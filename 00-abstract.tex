Deterministic application record and replay is the ability to record
application execution and deterministically replay it at a later time.
Record-replay has many potential uses, including diagnosing
and debugging applications by capturing and reproducing hard to find
bugs.

First, we present \scribe, an OS-level deterministic record-replay mechanism.
\scribe introduces new lightweight OS mechanisms, rendezvous and sync points, to
efficiently record nondeterministic interactions such as related system calls,
signals, and shared memory accesses.
Second, we present \racepro, a process race detection system to improve
software correctness. Process races occur when multiple processes access shared
operating system resources, such as files, without proper synchronization.
Third, we present \dora, a mutable record-replay system which allows a recorded
execution of an application to be replayed with a modified version of the
application.
Lastly, we present \synapse, an heterogeneous database replication system
specifically designed for web applications.

These four systems share many similarities as they are built on top of
record-replay systems. This thesis describes these four systems.
