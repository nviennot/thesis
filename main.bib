                    operating systems are not powerful enough to support
                    the performance and consistency requirements of
                    database systems. As a result, most database systems
                    are structured as Buffer Pool Database (BPDB) systems,
                    providing their own buffering facilities, with their
                    own paging policies and recovery schemes. The emergence
                    of operating systems with very large address spaces and
                    flexible memory management makes Virtual Memory
                    Database (VMDB) systems feasible. In such systems, the
                    database is mapped into virtual memory and the
                    buffering facilities of the underlying virtual memory
                    system are used. VMDB systems do not experience many of
                    the problems faced by BPDB systems. To support the
                    consistency and recoverability requirements of VMDB
                    systems, we have proposed that the virtual memory
                    system be extended to support the
                    Recoverable-Persistent Updates (RPU) model. This model
                    is powerful and general enough to support a wide
                    variety of policies for ensuring database
                    recoverability. In this paper we discuss our approach
                    to and progress in extending the Mach 3.0 kernel to
                    provide direct support for this RPU model.",

                    which runs on an arbitrarily large cluster of virtual

                    for managing virtual memory, independently of the
                    underlying hardware architecture (e.g. paged versus

                    particular, this interface provides abstractions for
                    support of a single, consistent cache for both mapped
                    objects and explicit I/O, and control of data caching

                 randomized resource allocation mechanism. Lottery
                 scheduling provides efficient, responsive control over
                 the relative execution rates of computations. Such
                 control is beyond the capabilities of conventional
                 schedulers, and is desirable in systems that service
                 requests of varying importance, such as databases,
                 media-based applications, and networks. Lottery
                 scheduling also supports modular resource management by
                 enabling concurrent modules to insulate their resource
                 allocation policies from one another. A currency
                 abstraction is introduced to flexibly name, share, and
                 protect resource rights. We also show that lottery
                 scheduling can be generalized to manage many diverse
                 resources, such as I/O bandwidth, memory, and access to
                 locks. We have implemented a prototype lottery
                 scheduler for the Mach 3.0 microkernel, and found that
                 it provides flexible and responsive control over the
                 relative execution rates of a wide range of
                 applications. The overhead imposed by our unoptimized
                 prototype is comparable to that of the standard Mach
                 timesharing policy.",

        Subject: automatic retarget

    Hi Max,

            Most retargets are to machines that already have a compiler;
    it should be possible to use this existing compiler to automatically
    retarget the new one (modulo some specific information about
    which registers can be used when, etc).  It might be possible
    to throw the superoptimizer at this problem as well: both to
    improve the quality of the generated code and to automatically
    retarget it as well.

            THis would be pretty cool, if you could pull it off.

    Dawson"

	abstract = {<p> Modern software model checkers find safety violations: breaches where the system enters some bad state. However, we argue that checking liveness properties offers both a richer and more natural way to search for errors, particularly in complex concurrent and distributed systems. Liveness properties specify desirable system behaviors which must be satisfied eventually, but are not always satisfied, perhaps as a result of failure or during system initialization. Existing software model checkers cannot verify liveness because doing so requires finding an infinite execution that does not satisfy a liveness property. We present heuristics to find a large class of liveness violations and the critical transition of the execution. The critical transition is the step in an execution that moves the system from a state that does not currently satisfy some liveness property\&\#151;but where recovery is possible in the future\&\#151;to a dead state that can never achieve the liveness property. Our software model checker, MACEMC, isolates complex liveness errors in our implementations of PASTRY, CHORD, a reliable transport protocol, and an overlay tree. </p>},

@article{LevesonCKS90,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an empirical study
        of software error detection using self checks and
        N-version voting. A total of 24 graduate students in
        computer science at the University of Virginia and the
        University of California, Irvine, were hired as
        programmers. Working independently, each first prepared
        a set of self checks to an existing implementation of
        that specification. The modified programs were executed
        to measure the error-detection performance of the
        checks and to compare this with error detection using
        simple voting among multiple versions. The goal of this
        study was to learn more about the effectiveness of such
        checks. The analysis of the checks revealed that there
        are great differences in the ability of individual
        programmers to design effective checks. We found that
        some checks which might have been effective failed to
        detect an error because they were badly placed, and
        there were numerous instances of checks signaling
        nonexistent errors. In general, specification-based
        checks alone were not as effective as combining them
        with code-based checks. Using self checks, faults were
        identified that had not been detected previously by
        voting 28 versions of the program over a million
        randomly-generated inputs. This appeared to result from
        the fact that the self checks could examine the
        internal state of the executing program whereas voting
        examines only the final results of computations. If
        internal states had to be consistent in N-version
        voting systems, then there would be no reason to write
        multiple versions. The programs were executed on 100,000
        new randomly-generated input cases in order to
        compare error detection by self checks and by 2-version
        and 3-version voting. Both self checks and voting
        techniques led to the identification of the same number
        of faults for this input, although the identified
        faults were not the same. Furthermore, whereas the self
        checks were always effective at detecting an error
        caused by a particular fault (if they ever did),
        N-version voting triples and pairs were only partially
        effective at detecting the failures caused by
        particular faults. Finally, checking the internal state
        with self checks also resulted in finding faults that
        did not cause failures for the particular input case
        executed. This has important implications for the use
        of back-to-back testing.},
