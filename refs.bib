@article{LevesonCKS90,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an empirical study
        of software error detection using self checks and
        N-version voting. A total of 24 graduate students in
        computer science at the University of Virginia and the
        University of California, Irvine, were hired as
        programmers. Working independently, each first prepared
        a set of self checks to an existing implementation of
        that specification. The modified programs were executed
        to measure the error-detection performance of the
        checks and to compare this with error detection using
        simple voting among multiple versions. The goal of this
        study was to learn more about the effectiveness of such
        checks. The analysis of the checks revealed that there
        are great differences in the ability of individual
        programmers to design effective checks. We found that
        some checks which might have been effective failed to
        detect an error because they were badly placed, and
        there were numerous instances of checks signaling
        nonexistent errors. In general, specification-based
        checks alone were not as effective as combining them
        with code-based checks. Using self checks, faults were
        identified that had not been detected previously by
        voting 28 versions of the program over a million
        randomly-generated inputs. This appeared to result from
        the fact that the self checks could examine the
        internal state of the executing program whereas voting
        examines only the final results of computations. If
        internal states had to be consistent in N-version
        voting systems, then there would be no reason to write
        multiple versions. The programs were executed on 100,000
        new randomly-generated input cases in order to
        compare error detection by self checks and by 2-version
        and 3-version voting. Both self checks and voting
        techniques led to the identification of the same number
        of faults for this input, although the identified
        faults were not the same. Furthermore, whereas the self
        checks were always effective at detecting an error
        caused by a particular fault (if they ever did),
        N-version voting triples and pairs were only partially
        effective at detecting the failures caused by
        particular faults. Finally, checking the internal state
        with self checks also resulted in finding faults that
        did not cause failures for the particular input case
        executed. This has important implications for the use
        of back-to-back testing.},
