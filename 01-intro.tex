Deterministic application record and replay is the ability to record
application execution and deterministically replay it at a later time.
Record-replay has many potential uses, including diagnosing
and debugging applications by capturing and reproducing hard to find
bugs, dynamic application analysis by performing costly
instrumentation on replicas that replay application behavior recorded
on production systems, intrusion analysis by capturing intrusions involving
non-deterministic effects, and fault-tolerance by providing
replicas that replay execution and at the occurrence of a fault, go
live in place of the previously running application instance.
